- 👋 Hi, I’m @mscheper
- 👀 I’m interested in accessibility, internationalisation, transport, renewable energy, social justice and compassionate working relationships.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about home ownership, and new skills with my hands. ☺
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project based on similar interests—see above.
- 📫 How to reach me? I think if you tag me here on GitHub, I'll see it.
